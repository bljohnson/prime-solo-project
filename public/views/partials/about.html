<h4>
	Search & Rescue is a web application that utilizes the Javascript-based MEAN stack in combination with the Rescue Groups API to allow users to find adoptable dogs based on search criteria they specify. This includes but is not limited to age, breed, size, and energy level. The search results made available to the user are intentionally scoped to adoptable dogs from shelters and rescues as a means of advocating for adoption and rescue. One by one, a user is presented with a simplified view of a dog with minimal information about it. The user can then bypass a dog or 'like' a dog, which will automatically save that dog to their personal Favorites list that they can return to at any time to reference. For each dog, the user can also click on a 'More' button to pull up a modal with further details about the dog. Where available, the data pulled for each dog will include contact information for the rescue/shelter (e.g. link to their website), so the user has the ability to contact them directly regarding adoption.
