<h4>
	Welcome to Search & Rescue, an interactive and precise tool created to enable users like yourself to find adoptable dogs. This web application utilizes the powerful Rescue Groups API, and search results are intentionally scoped to adoptable dogs from shelters and rescues as a means of advocating for adoption and rescue. After entering your search criteria, you can skip over or express interest in a dog. Expressing interest will automatically save that dog to your Favorites list that you can return to at any time to reference. Where available, the data pulled for each dog will include contact information for the rescue/shelter (e.g. link to their website, phone number, etc), so you can contact them directly regarding adoption of one of their dogs.
