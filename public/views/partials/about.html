<h4>
	Welcome to Search & Rescue, a web application created to enable users like yourself to find adoptable dogs. This application utilizes the powerful Rescue Groups API, and search results are intentionally scoped to adoptable dogs from shelters and rescues as a means of advocating for adoption and rescue. After entering your search criteria (all fields except breed are required), they can express disinterest or interest in a dog. Expressing interest will automatically save that dog to their personal Favorites list that they can return to at any time to reference. Where available, the data pulled for each dog will include contact information for the rescue/shelter (e.g. link to their website, phone number, etc), so the user has the ability to contact them directly regarding adoption of one of their dogs.
